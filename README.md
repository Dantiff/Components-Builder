# Components-Builder
> An app carrying multiple custom components commonly shared within different apps

## Material UI
In this setup, the app selects [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/), a popular material component framwork with over _6,500_ tags on github, to illustrate basic/advanced setup and usage of Google's material UI with VueJS.

## Charts
Since most of the advanced JavaScript chart packages and available tutorials and examples for the same conform to the es5 release of Javascript, this app takes an initiative to the usage of most popular and advance chart packages including _chart.js_, _highcharts_, and _ndv3_ charts using the lastest es6 and es7 releases of JavaScript.
some of the chart examples covered in the app include:
###### 1. HighCharts
+MultiLinear charts
+TimeSeries Charts
